Started on February 13th so progress made prior to that isn't recorded here

	  /	(Completed 2/13)
	\/  Install libadwaita dev dependencies

	  /	(2/13)
	\/  Fix Dbus crate not finding system Dbus

	  /	(2/13)
	\/  I might need to switch to a different Rust dbus crate. dbus-rs is being weird
		Alternatives include zbus and rustbus
		zbus is very active, has recent updates, and lots of contributors. Gonna switch to it

	  /	(2/13)
	\/  Add asynchronous runtime

	Flesh out UI: Settings menu, sidebar, top bar, etc
		Use Workbench from flatpak for this. Lots of great examples and can generate the Rust code for me

	Start writing functions to interact with DBUS API using zbus crate

	Start writing functions to poll current processes for auto-profile-switching
